Paioo User - Drupal 7
==========

Drupal 7 module that splits the User edit page into separate 
* "Edit Account", 
* "Edit Profile", 
* and "Change Password" pages

This borrows the idea/code from the [Edit Profile] (http://drupal.org/project/edit_profile) module, specifically
for separating out the account and profile (field) info.

I'm also borrowing from the "Password Tab" submodule in the [Password Policy] (http://drupal.org/project/password_policy) module.

Aside from combining this functionality together, this module also remaps the menu to create a single "Edit" tab on
the user pages with sub tabs for the profile/account/password form pages.

The goal of this module is to make the user edit pages a bit friendlier and less confusing.
